 wave of A.I. technologies and A.I. businesses. We  

 will start off with our main hypothesis of why A.I. is

will look at examples of companies leveraging this  

 new technology to disrupt existing industries and  

     create new ones. This will hopefully give the  

 reader some feeling of what kind of applications

We are living in the midst of a surge of interest and  

research into Artificial Intelligence (hereby A.I.). It can  

seem like every week there is a new breakthrough in the  

field and a new record set in some task previously done  

by humans. Not too long ago, A.I. seemed a distant  

dream for especially interested researchers. Today it is all  

around us. We carry it in our pockets, it's in our cars and  
                                                                                     No easy definition of what is AI  
in many of the web services we use throughout the day.  
                                                                                        and what is just normal IT.  
As this technology matures, every business must ask itself  

the central question: how will this disrupt my industry?               between the two concepts. For the purpose of this  

Throughout this research paper, we will investigate the                paper, it is best to avoid the technical definitions used  

possible implications of the rise of A.I. on the banking               by academics in the field, and instead think of AI  

industry.                                                              technology as the sort of technology you would use to

What is Artificial Intelligence?                                       accomplish. With the added feature that AI systems  

If we ask Wikipedia; Artificial Intelligence (AI) is "the              often are the kind of systems deployed in domains

The only thing you need to know about A.I.  

This is not the first period of massive public interest in A.I.  

In fact, A.I.'s long history of being “The Next Big Thing”  

has led the current top researchers in the field to publicly  

downplay their findings, in order to avoid the hype  

getting out of hand. Ever since the start of the field, the  

long term goal of A.I. research has been what is called  
                                                                                              A.I has followed a classic boom

every intelligence task that a human can perform.  
Roughly every decade since the 1950's, promises have                           been made about the impending arrival of Strong A.I.,  

                                                                               and every time these promises were broken, all the

2. WHY A.I. IS DIFFERENT THIS TIME   

                WHY A.I. IS DIFFERENT THIS TIME   
    2  

It is a saying in finance that the most expensive four  

words in the English language is “This time it's different”.  

The saying is meant to imprint caution in the mind of  

people looking to invest in hyped assets with a history of  

disappointment. Given the history of A.I., one might do  

well to keep this in mind. However, is it possible to find  

any justification for why it is, in fact, different this time?  
                                                                                         Google, Facebook, Baidu etc.  
Kevin Kelly, the founding executive editor of Wired, lists  
                                                                                        are hiring all the A.I. experts they  
the following three reasons.  
                                                                                              can get their hands on  
  
The decreasing cost of computing power                                     calculations that used to take up to several weeks, now  

Thinking, for all practical purposes, is computation. And                  take less then a day, and the time is shrinking. Building  

in order to simulate a system that is even remotely                        intelligent applications would simply not be possible  

intelligent, a great number of computations are needed.                    without the increase in cheap, available computing  

Moore's law, which says that the number of transistors on                  power that we have been fortunate to witness the last  

integrated circuits double roughly every two years, has                    decades.  

provided growing computational capacity for the last                        

five decades. But this is not enough. Luckily, it was                       

discovered during the last decade that GPUs, the chips                      

used for generating computer graphics in video games                        

etc., were eminently suited to run the sort of massive                      

parallel computations needed for building A.I.                              

architecture. In practical terms, this has meant that

The availability of data  

It is no coincidence that the recent intense interest in A.I.  

from the tech industry comes right after Big Data  

became a household word. The by far biggest investors  

in A.I. technology are Facebook, Google, Yahoo, Baidu  

and Microsoft. They have hired almost all the leading  

researchers in the field and setup their own research labs  
                                                                                                 Several breakthroughs in

internally. The common denominator for these                                   engine. Watson is a distributed cognitive system,  

companies is that they sit on truly massive amounts of                         meaning that it is spread out in the cloud, collecting  

data that they need to analyze. A.I. bears the promise of                      information every time it's being used, everywhere. This

Better algorithms  

A new type of algorithms lies at the heart of this new A.I.  

wave and it's safe to say that without these, the data  

and computing power would amount to nothing. It  

might come as a surprise that it is all based on  

technology from the 50's, called Artificial Neural  

Networks (ANN), which is an attempt to model the

                 WHAT IS INTELLIGENCE  
    3  

The field of A.I. can seem quite daunting for non- 

specialists and part of the reason for this is because the  

way we think about intelligence has changed during the  

last couple of decades. This has had the result that it can  

be very hard for non-experts to understand what this  

technology can be used for. As will be explained in this  

section, it's all about changing how one thinks about  
                                                                                                 General A.I. would have a  
intelligence.

In the beginning of the field of A.I.'s existence, one  

thought that the way to approach it was to instill a                              

computer with logical 'rules' that would result in rational                       

behavior, and then populate this computer with facts                              

about the world in a big “Knowledge Table”. This                                  

approach was later shown to be doomed to fail.                                    

Manually typing in facts about the world, and hoping                              

that strict rules would help the computer understand the                          

relations between these facts, becomes exponentially
