                           no small part to the explosion of data that is        with advanced skills, with specialists in the  
                           available in some areas, such as image or             field being highly sought after, and additional  
                           speech recognition. This data has provided            resources to increase this talent pool are

The Royal Society conducted research to                 Machine learning is a vibrant field of  
understand the views of members of the                  research, with a range of exciting areas  
public towards machine learning. While                  for further development across different  
most people were not aware of the term,                 methods and applications. In addition to  
they did know of some of its applications.              those areas of research that address purely  
There was not a single common view, with                technical questions, there is a collection  
attitudes, both positive and negative, varying          of specific research questions where  
depending on the circumstances in which                 progress would directly address areas of  
machine learning was being used. Ongoing                public concern around machine learning,  
engagement with the public will be important            or constraints on its wider use. Support  
as the field develops.                                  for research in these areas can therefore  
                                                        help ensure continued public confidence  
Machine learning applications can perform well          in the deployment of machine learning  
at specific tasks. In many cases it can be used         systems. These areas include algorithmic  
to augment human roles. Although it is clear            interpretability, robustness, privacy, fairness,  
that developments in machine learning will              inference of causality, human-machine  
change the world of work, predicting how this           interaction, and security. 
will unfold is not straightforward, and existing  
studies differ substantially in their projections.  
While offering potential for new businesses  
or areas of the UK economy to thrive, the  
disruptive potential of machine learning brings  
with it challenges for society, and questions  
about its social consequences. Some of these  
challenges relate to the way in which new  
uses of data reframe traditional concepts of,  
for example, privacy or consent, while others  
relate to how people interact with machine  
learning systems. Careful stewardship will  
be needed to ensure that the productivity  
dividend from machine learning benefits all  
in society.

A NEW WAVE OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH 

Progress in some areas of machine  
learning research will impact directly on the  
social acceptability of machine learning in  
applications and hence on public confidence  
and trust. Funding bodies should encourage  
and support research applications in these  
areas, though not to the exclusion of other  
areas of machine learning research. These  
areas include algorithm interpretability,  
robustness, privacy, fairness, inference of  
causality, human-machine interactions, and  
security.

The game Go originated in China over                      This learning was put to the test in 2016,  
2500 years ago. It is a game with relatively              in a series of matches against Lee Sedol,

incredibly complex, due to the huge  
number of potential moves. Successful Go                  These victories demonstrated the ability of  
players therefore rely on intuition or instinct           machine learning to tackle hugely complex  
to play the game, rather than a rigid set                 tasks, and in doing so to produce solutions  
of instructions.                                          which humans may not have considered;  
                                                          pivotal moves played by AlphaGo had only

large number of potential moves in Go.  
Researchers at DeepMind therefore  
followed a different approach: using  
stochastic searches and deep neural  
networks, they trained AlphaGo on 30 million  
moves from games played by humans. To  
further enhance its abilities, they then used  
reinforcement learning to allow AlphaGo  
to learn from thousands of games it played  
against itself.

of accuracy.                                             presented with a new piece of text and, using

One method of achieving this is via neural               and use these to make a decision about

fairly widespread, and is often insisted on by                      academic data, as noted in the Royal Society’s  
journals in this field. These summary statistics                     report on Science as an open enterprise.

 privacy of individuals in the study. 

 For the benefits of data availability to be fully  
 realised, data from research needs to be  
 produced in a way that makes it: accessible,  
so others can find it; intelligible, so it can be  
scrutinised; assessable, so its reliability can  
 be judged before use; and usable by others98.  

  
 Publishing data in this way can also help  
 increase the impact of research. For example,  
 in a study of cancer microarray data, the co- 
 publication of publicly available data was found  
to be associated with a 69% increase in citation  
of the original publication99.  

97.   Notable examples of these practices include the UK Biobank (See http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/) and the Wellcome Trust  
      Case Control Consortium (See https://www.wtccc.org.uk/).

Creating good simulations of real-world data  
is often a hard problem, which requires a  
thorough understanding of the complexities  
of the system giving rise to the data under  
consideration. Use of simulations therefore  
requires some care. If a simulation fails to  
capture important properties of the real- 
world problem being investigated, analyses  
based on its data can be misleading. Even if a  
simulation is highly accurate in contained, well- 
defined environments, and the resulting model  
is trained on the basis of accurate data from  
this environment, complexity or nuance from  
a real world scenario may be lost, resulting in  
decreased accuracy or incorrect results when  
the model is deployed in the real world. As a  
consequence, considerable caution is needed  
before relying too heavily on simulated data in  
many real-world settings.

Another approach is to proceed in two stages.                  A neural network is an approach  
First, a prediction system is designed solely to               to machine learning in which small

and operation of the first system. There is                    the brain. These systems may consist of  
promising recent work in this direction. One                   many layers of neurons: the base layer  
idea is to explore predictions locally; another                receives an input from an external source,  
is to examine the sensitivity of predictions to                then each layer beyond it detects patterns

approach is essentially approximating an                       beneath, integrates these inputs, and then

reasoning. This may seem very appealing, but                   or weaken synaptic connections to make

                           robustness of machine learning systems. For           overly cautious approach could lead to poor  
                           example, so-called training / test splits of data     performance in typical conditions.  
                           can be used to verify predictions, by training an  
                           algorithm using a sub-set of the available data,      Another approach is to create systems that are  
                           and then putting it to use on another sub-set of      context aware. A system which can monitor its

                           two limitations. Firstly, when deployed in the        the method with which it was trained – if the  
                           ‘real world’, the system may encounter data that      context matches – or raise an alert and use  
                           falls far outside the range of that covered by        more cautious approaches, if the context is

                           drawn from testing might not be generalisable  
                           upon deployment. In the first instance, this is       Verification and robustness of machine

                           data as possible, with as close a match as            learning, small changes to a system can be
