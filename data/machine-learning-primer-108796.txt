Yes! Machines learn by studying data to detect patterns or by applying known 
rules to:

 • Categorize or catalog like people or things

 • Predict likely outcomes or actions based on identified patterns

 • Identify hitherto unknown patterns and relationships

 • Detect anomalous or unexpected behaviors 

The processes machines use to learn are known as algorithms. Different algorithms 
learn in different ways. As new data regarding observed responses or 
changes to the environment are provided to the “machine” the algorithm’s 
performance improves. Thereby resulting in increasing “intelligence” over 
time.

With the advent of big data, both the amount of data available and our ability 
to process it has increased exponentially. The ability of machines to learn 
and thus appear ever more intelligent has increased proportionally. Even so, 
machines aren’t independent thinkers (yet).

Yes, machine learning may identify previously unidentified opportunities or 
problems to be solved. But the machine is not autonomously creative. The 
machine will not spontaneously develop new hypotheses from facts (data) 
not in evidence. Nor can the machine determine a new way to respond to 
emerging stimuli. 

Remember: the output of a machine learning algorithm is entirely dependent 
on the data it is exposed to. Change the data, change the result.

Personalized Marketing

Companies are better than ever at understanding why customers buy their products, use their 
services, or engage their expertise. We can point the “machine” at a lake of consumer data to detect 
patterns and preferred channels for consumption. It can use historical and real-time data to determine 
that I, a frequent business traveler and coffee addict, may welcome a real-time message that my 
favorite coffee shop is around the corner. My dad would not welcome this interaction. He brews his 
coffee at home and will respond to a coupon in the mail. Which can also include incentives for other 
items he might buy on his next grocery outing. 

The machine is optimizing activities for each customer across known channels (digital, paper, brick 
and mortar). It won’t, however, independently create a new interaction channel that doesn’t already 
exist. 



A Machine Learning Primer: Machine Learning Defined

In simple terms, machine learning is particularly suited to problems where: 

 • Applicable associations or rules might be intuited, but are not easily 
codified or described by simple logical rules. 

 • Potential outputs or actions are defined but which action to take 
is dependent on diverse conditions which cannot be predicted or 
uniquely identified before an event happens. 

 • Accuracy is more important than interpretation or interpretability. 

 • The data is problematic for traditional analytic techniques. Specifically, 
wide data (data sets with a large number of data points or 
attributes in every record compared to the number of records) and 
highly correlated data (data with similar or closely related values) can 
present problems for traditional analytic methods.

Problems

That Lend
Themselves 
to Machine 
Learning



Identifying People and Things In Pictures 

A practiced machine learning algorithm could recognize the face of a known “person of interest” in a 
crowded airport scene, thereby preventing the person from boarding a flight—or worse.

Social media platforms utilize machine learning to automatically tag people and identify common 
objects such as landmarks in uploaded photos. 

Why Is This a Machine Learning Problem? 

Image data is complicated. The number of pixels in each image make the data set wider than it is 
deep. Pixels close to one another have similar values making the data highly correlated. Images of the 
same subject have multiple subtle (and not-so-subtle) variations. 

Of course, you can easily recognize people known to you - and those that aren’t – in pictures; even 
when they have different expressions, poses or clothes. You can also identify “like” items both conceptually 
(i.e., animal, mineral or vegetable) and concretely (i.e., dog, cat, fish). But can you translate that 
knowledge into simple steps and discrete rules for how you made the match? 



Genomics

Machine learning can help discover what genes are involved in specific disease pathways. 

Machine learning can also be used to determine which treatments will be most effective for an individual 
patient based on their genetic makeup, demographic and psychographic characteristics. 

Why Is This a Machine Learning Problem? 

Genomic data is wide: every person has more than 20,000 genes. As a result, the number of genes 
(data points) in an individual record is always larger than the number of people (records) in any data 
set. 

A number of factors add to the complexity. Including, but not limited to: the high degree of variation 
within each of those 20,000+ genes. The fact that your relatives have similar genomes (making 
them highly correlated). That relatively few individuals may suffer from a given disease making the 
data pool extremely shallow. Last but not least, genes in isolation may not predict health outcomes or 
disease expression. Biochemical, environmental and other factors must also be considered, thereby 
requiring integrated data from multiple, diverse sources. 



Navigation and the Self-Driving Car

Machine learning can identify the best routes from point A to B, predict transit conditions and travel 
time and predict the best route based on current, evolving road conditions.

Machine Learning can drive a car without requiring input from a driver. 

Why Is This a Machine Learning Problem? 

Driving is a complicated but well-bounded problem. There are, in fact, a limited number of actions 
a vehicle may take: start, stop, go forward, go backward, turn, speed up and slow down. However, 
the decision to take any of action is influenced by numerous factors including but not limited to road 
conditions, weather conditions, presence and behavior of other vehicles, two-legged persons and 
their four-legged friends, and the rules of the road – just to name a few. While a human driver instinctually 
assesses all these inputs on the fly, capturing discrete rules for every possible combination is 
impossible.

In supervised learning the machine is taught by example. Examples of the 
desired inputs and outputs are provided. The “machine” (aka the algorithm) 
uses this input to determine correlations and logic that can be used to predict 
the answer.

This is like giving students an answer key and asking them to “show their 
work.” In supervised learning, sample Q&A are provided. The machine fills in 
how to get from A to B. Once the logical pattern is identified, it can be applied 
to solve similar problems.

Semi-supervised learning is used to address similar problems as supervised 
learning. However, in semi-supervised learning the machine is provided some 
data with the answer defined (aka labeled) along with additional data that 
is not labeled with the answer. In other words, the some of the input data is 
tagged with desired output (answer) while the remainder is untagged. 

Semi-supervised learning is used in cases where there is too much data or 
subtle variations in the data to be able to provide a comprehensive set of 
examples. In this case, the provided inputs and outputs provide the general 
pattern the machine can extrapolate and apply to the remaining data.

Unsupervised
Learning

In unsupervised learning, the machine studies data to identify patterns. In 
this case, there is no answer key. The machine determines correlations and 
relationships by parsing the available data. 

Unsupervised learning is modeled on how we humans naturally observe 
the world: drawing inferences and grouping like things based on unconstrained 
observation and intuition. As our experience grows (or in the case 
of the machine – the amount of data it is exposed to grows) our intuition and 
observations change and/or become more refined.

Reinforcement 
Learning

In reinforcement learning the machine is provided a set of allowed actions, 
rules and potential end states. In other words, the rules of the game are 
defined. By applying the rules, exploring different actions and observing 
resulting reactions the machine learns to exploit the rules to create a desired 
outcome. Thus determining what series of actions, in what circumstances, will 
lead to an optimal or optimized result. 

Reinforcement learning is the equivalent of teaching someone to play a game. 
The rules and objectives are clearly defined. However, the outcome of any 
single game depends on the judgment of the player who must adjust his 
approach in response to the incumbent environment, skill and actions of a 
given opponent.

Deep Learning


A modern, advanced machine learning technique that makes use of extremely sophisticated 
neural networks. Called deep learning because the models generated 
are 
significantly more complex or deep than traditional neural networks. Deep learning 
models also ingest vastly larger amounts of data than their predecessors.

Why Is This Important?

Deep learning is the underpinning of many advanced machine learning systems 
today. Perhaps most importantly, deep learning has vastly improved our ability to 
understand and analyze image, sound and video. This has been made possible by 
major advances in machine learning research as well as vast increases in both available 
data and massive computing power.

Cognitive Computing

Systems that seek to understand and emulate human behavior. As well as to provide a 
more natural and intuitive interface between man and machine. This typically involves 
deploying systems that interface with people in their “native tongue.” In other words, 
without requiring a user to write or understand code. Cognitive computing platforms 
accomplish this using a myriad of techniques including natural language processing, 
advanced machine learning algorithms (including deep learning) and natural 
language generation.

Why Is This Important?

Cognitive computing makes machines (software systems) more accessible and intuitive 
to engage with. As a result, cognitive computing may be the key to increasing 
adoption of automated systems and analytic solutions. Ultimately, transcending the 
man vs. machine barrier in favor of cooperative systems in which man and machine 
seamlessly work together. This is a precursor of what people commonly think of when 
speaking of artificial intelligence.

Natural Language Processing


Capabilities that allow machines to understand written language, voice commands 
or both. Natural language processing (NLP) includes the ability to translate language 
into a form that a machine or algorithm can understand. Natural language generation 
(NLG) allows the machine to then communicate results or responses in “plain English” 
(or any language it’s designed to support). 

Why Is This Important?

Some NLP tools simply perform translation, mapping the words in a command to 
a dictionary. More sophisticated applications strive for understanding: inferring 
meaning or intent in order to inform an appropriate action or response. Given broad 
variances in dialects, figures of speech, colloquialisms, individual mannerisms and 
the rapid evolution of new modes of communication (abbreviations, emoticons) this 
undertaking is not trivial.

Unlike traditional statistical models, the models created by machine 
learning algorithms are extremely complex. While there is a method 
to the madness, it is not immediately obvious or linear. The exact path 
through a neural network, for example, is not easy to trace. Thousands 
(and even billions!) of rules or parameters can define the model. As a 
result, the exact internal processing pathways are a black box, even to 
the data scientist! 

The more important question: is the algorithm or method being 
applied appropriately to the problem at hand?

Why Can’t 
Anyone 
Explain How 
the Machine 
Reached this 
Conclusion?



A Machine Learning Primer: Points to Ponder

If the analytic mechanisms or - more specifically, the logical 
processing pathway or rules - are not clear or easily reproducible, how 
do you validate results? 

Don’t confuse black box processing with blind faith. When it comes to 
machine learning validation is deceptively simple. 

When tested against new data:

 • Does the algorithm accurately predict future events or result 
in desired outcomes? 

 • Can you put the output into action? 

That’s it. No more, no less. 

 If ML 
Algorithms

Boxes, How 
Can I Trust 
Them?



A Machine Learning Primer: Points to Ponder

Is It Really 
That Simple?

The validation criteria for a machine learning algorithm are simple. The 
process of selecting, auditing and tuning an algorithm to deliver these 
results is anything but. 

Numerous factors must be accounted for: what algorithm(s) best suit 
the problem or data? What data elements (aka features) should be 
included? Can the data be cleansed, transformed or refined to better 
expose key elements to the model (aka feature extraction and engineering)? 
How should the algorithm’s parameters be configured or 
tuned for optimal performance? 

The model must also be cross-validated and audited to avoid artificially 
engineering a deceptively accurate response (aka overfitting). An 
(admittedly) simplistic example: it is relatively easy to create a model 
that predicts yesterday’s weather with a high degree of accuracy. But 
that same model may not predict tomorrow’s weather as ably. Or be 
the only model that works. 

Ultimately, developing a functional machine learning system is an iterative 
and intensive process that is part art and a lot of science.



A Machine Learning Primer: Points to Ponder

Is 
Complicated 
and Clean 
Always Better?

Not always. Like traditional analytics, a majority of time on machine 
learning projects is spent munging, validating and formatting data. But 
while data quality is always a concern, good enough is in the eye of 
the algorithm. Sometimes a simple algorithm with more data can often 
beat a complicated algorithm with less data. Even when the bigger 
data set is slightly dirtier. 

When it comes to model accuracy, the higher the better. Or so it 
would seem; especially to the inexperienced. However, for many practical 
applications minute improvements in model accuracy will not 
result in germane operational improvements for the business. More 
data and features may also unnecessarily complicate the algorithm. 
The balancing act is between complexity and the ability to consume. 

Note! Andrew Ng, Chief Data Scientist for Baidu and a leading ML 
researcher, has posited that future advances in machine learning will 
be less about new algorithms and more about enabling algorithms to 
become smarter vis-a-vis the data that is fed into them.



A Machine Learning Primer: Points to Ponder

Machine learning is a tool in the analytics toolbox. Like any tool it 
must be thoughtfully applied lest it becomes the proverbial hammer 
looking for a nail. As machine learning emerged from academia, early 
adopters often found themselves expending significant time and effort 
on problems that could have been easily solved utilizing traditional 
statistical algorithms. 

Therefore, machine learning is best seen as a supplement, not a 
wholesale replacement, for traditional analytic methods. 

Does ML 
Make My 
Existing 
Analytics 
Obsolete?



Machine learning in practice requires human application of the scientific 
method and human communication skills. 

The recipe is not as simple as: add data and stir. 

Humans, above and beyond the data scientist programming the algorithm, 
are required to answer questions such as:

 • What are we trying to predict? 

 • Are resulting correlations predictive? Causal? Are there 
inherent biases? 

 • Are results in line with expectations? Are there exceptions to 
be addressed? 

 • What is the predictive value and can it be generalized? 

 • Can the model and results be applied in real life? 

 • What is the proper response?

Machine learning is a synergistic exercise between man and machine. 

Machine learning in practice requires human application of the 
scientific method and human communication skills. Successful 
organizations have the analytic infrastructure, expertise and close 
collaboration between analytics and business subject matter experts.

Educate the Business on Concepts, not Theorems

#

Depending on your point of view, the inner workings of a neural network or deep learning 
algorithm are riveting. Or, horribly complicated and mind-numbing. The truth is that most 
people don’t need (and aren’t going to) understand the details. Which isn’t to say education 
isn’t required. Making the case for time and funding requires executives and business laypersons 
to broadly understand what machine learning can do. 

A story that demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to your business will garner 
more engagement than complicated algorithmic charts and discussions of p-values . Rather 
than waxing rhapsodic about the technical nitty-gritty share examples of problems machine 
learning can solve. Include case studies from other industries and like companies. If you must 
explain the method itself, think analogies not engineering diagrams.



2

Make Machine Learning Part of the Discovery Process

#

Machine learning algorithms observe behaviors or the environment, detect a pattern, make a 
generalization and infer an explanation or theory. The resulting probabilistic correlations may 
predict outcomes with a high degree of accuracy. They do not necessarily pinpoint the factors 
which create the outcome. 

The bottom line? Prediction and causation are not the same. Business and policy decisions 
must consider this when deciding if and how to put found insights into action. In some cases, 
machine learning may identify areas for further study and consideration. In others, machine 
learning algorithms themselves might be integrated into operational systems to automate key 
decision points or processing pathways in real time.



CASE IN POINT


A Machine Learning Primer: Best Practices

33

Consider the following two cases:

The book Freakonomics highlights a case study in which the number of books 
in a home was correlated to high standardized test scores. The study led to a 
mayoral program to send free books home to poorly performing children. The 
results were decidedly less than stellar.

Contrast this with a study at the University of Ontario in which telemetry from 
devices attached to premature babies in neonatal intensive care was analyzed 
in real time. The systems predicted, with a high degree of accuracy, when a 
premature infant was developing an infection. Even though clinical symptoms 
did not present themselves until 48 hours later. The researchers and clinicians 
still do not know HOW the machine identified the onset of infection. But in this 
case, the important point was that it COULD. Ultimately, the team had to be 
comfortable working and acting on correlation, without fully understanding 
the causal relationship.



Avoid Black Box Exercises

3

#

Yes, machine learning methods can seem obscure and are, in fact, often inscrutable. But 
applying machine learning is not a black box activity. Humans, above and beyond the data 
scientist programming the algorithm, are required to answer questions such as:

What are we trying to predict?

Like any analytic endeavor, machine learning projects should start with a clear statement of 
the problem space or hypothesis to be explored. 

What is best likely input into the process?

Data scientists and subject matter experts must work together to figure out the sources of 
data and the key features for the machine. Data visualization can play a key role in helping to 
highlight and test features that can be fed into machine learning algorithms. 

Note! Even in unsupervised learning the machine doesn’t operate autonomously. Results are 
affected by decisions about what data to expose. The Google machine vision experiment independently 
identified pictures of cats. A different picture set would have resulted in a different 
entity being identified. 



Are results in line with expectations? Are there exceptions to be addressed? What are implications 
if they are not? 

Consider Stanford and Google’s work in computer vision. While dang good, it’s not foolproof. 
Goats get characterized as dogs, a field of tulips as hot air balloons. Minor gaffs to be sure, 
but what are the implications when people are incorrectly categorized? 

How can (and should) results be applied? 

Machine learning is great at determining what to do. Not necessarily so good at defining how 
(although this is changing fast).

What is the proper response? 

For instance, when a pattern emerges with global health or political ramifications what is the 
proper next step or steps?

Avoid Black Box Exercises (cont’d)

Apply Appropriate Scientific Rigor

4

#

Machine learning does not negate the need for solid statistical reasoning, scientific and data 
analysis. While extremely powerful, it is not a magical, self-correcting analytical panacea. At 
least not yet.

Machine learning is most effective when the data scientist has a solid understanding about 
how to structure the system. In other words, the developer can identify the appropriate 
algorithm(s) based on the domain and how attributes of the data will respond. The process 
requires both knowledge of the characteristics of different algorithms and a healthy dose of 
intuition.

Forewarning! Even with experience, developing a machine learning application is an experimental 
and iterative process: regardless of whether the team is using well-known algorithms. 
In every case, the algorithms must be trained and tuned for the business context and data at 
hand. 

Teams must also apply a healthy (but not paralyzing) dose of skepticism and rigor to validate 
the model lest they fall into the trap of “believing everything they think.” 



CASE IN POINT


A Machine Learning Primer: Best Practices

Examples of failure to critically analyze analytic models abound. 

In one instance, a team of genomics scientists created an algorithm for 
predicting a patient’s response to chemotherapy. Unfortunately, they didn’t 
account for data variations and data integrity issues in their initial training 
data set. This led to some unfortunate consequences, the least of which were 
canceled clinical trials.

In another, economists published a paper adversely linking GDP growth 
with high government debt. Questions were later raised regarding factor 
weighting used in the regression model which, when modified, led to dramatically 
different conclusions. 



Make it Just Complicated Enough

5

#

Generally speaking, more data wins. But do more features (aka attributes or data points) also 
equate to better outcomes? Not always. The catch-22 is that larger data sets beget larger variations 
in data and a larger potential for predictive error. 

In many cases, weaker models with more data do better than more complicated models with 
less. Even if the data is dirtier. This is the basis of ensemble modeling techniques which use 
the ‘power of the collective’ to predict results.

Deploying machine learning artfully is a balancing act. One in which the incremental predictive 
value of complexity must be weighed against interpretability, ease of use and applicability. 


Of course, simplicity is not the only virtue. Ultimately, the model must also perform well under 
realistic operating conditions.



The best model is for naught if it can’t be put into operational practice. 
Consider the Netflix Prize in which Netflix challenged the data science 
community to create a highly performing model to predict “what you should 
watch next.” The winning model exceeded all expectations; predicting user 
preferences at an unprecedented level. 

The problem? The model’s data and processing requirements made it impossible 
to execute in real time or near real time – a key requirement when trying 
to attract the attention of users looking for a flick to watch right now! The 
result? A fantastically accurate model with no applicable business value.



Actively Engage Business Users in Validation

6

#

The data scientist must apply due diligence as the model is created and tuned. To do so, they 
must effectively communicate and collaborate with data and business domain experts to validate 
and vet the model. This is critical to ensure the team has, amongst other things: 

Validated that all the options have been considered.

A model being significantly accurate doesn’t preclude other equally well-fitting models from 
existing. And those models may suggest alternate conclusions. 

Accounted for potential bias.

Algorithms – for all that they feed on data – are not inherently fool-proof or unbiased. Beyond 
subconscious biases unwittingly introduced, the data provided to a model can reflect biases 
by virtue of the decisions by which the data was created. As mathematician Jeremy Kun 
elegantly stated, “training on human-generated data (aka found data) means the inherent 
biases of a population (minority or majority) or the underlying process will be inherited.” 

Identified the impact and implications of putting found insight into action.



Employ Data Storytelling

#

Like other techniques, machine learning insights can suffer a failure in translation between the 
data science teams and end consumers. Therefore, in addition to questions posed above, the 
team must carefully consider how found insights will be delivered and consumed. 

To start, teams must determine how to present in a manner that is palatable and consumable. 
This is particularly important when found insights challenge existing paradigms or require 
changes to standard operating procedures. Rather than slaying your audience with numbers 
and statistical values, can the results be visualized and supported by a compelling story? 

Forewarned! Don’t make up a compelling story. Rather, create a narrative that shows how the 
findings drive operational improvements or enable innovative new products and services – in 
terms and context the audience understands.

Don’t Underestimate the Power of Perception

With machine learning, an individual’s future actions can be predicted with a high degree of 
confidence. Creating the potential for what data scientist John Foreman, MailChimp’s chief 
data scientist and self-professed “recovering management consultant” called “laser-guided 
disingenuous arguments” for targeting and marketing. The ethics (including the privacy vs. 
value debate) are important and must be addressed upfront. 

Another consideration: how does our expectation of fallibility change when a machine 
decides? 

As “machines” increasingly encroach into visible decision-making roles and engagement we 
must account for the human reaction. Building trust in these systems is critical for full adoption 
and engagement.



CASE IN POINT


A Machine Learning Primer: Best Practices

What happens when a self-navigating car crashes? How likely are we to 
forgive that accident? Even if it’s a mistake a human driver makes with greater 
frequency. 

Studies have shown machine learning to be 72 percent accurate in diagnosing 
breast cancer from a mammogram. A human doctor? 65 percent. But does a 
patient’s expectation change when a machine makes or misses the diagnosis? 



Proactively Adapt Business Processes

#

Deploying machine learning systems may require us to be willing to give up control as we 
automate certain decisions and actions. Machine learning may also enable development of 
entirely new products, services or customer engagement models. 

Careful consideration must be given to the resulting business implications. 

 • Is the organization ready and willing to take action and make necessary changes to 
incorporate found insights? 

 • What existing business processes and roles must be modified?

 • Will net new processes or roles be required? 

 • If the machine learning model will be autonomous, how will automated systems work 
within the context of human workflows? Make sense to their human counterparts or 
co-workers?



Manufacturers are applying machine learning to identify potential equipment 
failures just in time, before they happen. This requires fitting equipment with 
sensors and embedding analytic sensing systems. It also precipitates a fundamental 
rethink of customer service, maintenance and warranty policies and 
procedures. 

Merchandisers are utilizing machine learning for real-time online pricing. In 
this case, the machine determines optimal price points while gross thresholds 
are validated by humans. A feedback loop allows the algorithm to learn 
from observed sales results. Another takes buyer input on missed opportunities 
or errors. This seemingly simple shift required a seismic change in how 
merchandisers and buyers were measured and incented. 

In Amazon’s automated distribution centers humans do the packing while 
robotic systems collect required supplies and validate the right stuff gets in 
the box. What makes it all work? The interaction between human and robot. 
Underscoring the point that deliberate design of not just the algorithm, but 
the ongoing engagement between man and machine, is critical to success.

Plan for Ongoing Care and Feeding

#

To stay current and deliver results, machine learning algorithms must be continuously 
refreshed and refined based on data that reflect current circumstances. This is true whether 
evaluating the impact of new customer micro-segments on retention or rebalancing the 
network to account for unexpected spikes in energy demands to avoid blackouts. 

If you apply machine learning successfully – incenting consumers to buy more, utilize different 
commercial channels, and turn right not left – the patterns used to create the model are 
changed. Machine learning models need to adjust to account for these shifts in behavior. Your 
business processes do too.

In this case, operationalization is not a merely keep the lights on activity. Maintaining the 
model is a critical, ongoing process that requires as much, if not more, due diligence as initial 
model development.

Articulate a Problem That Needs Solving

Machine learning works best when there is a clear problem statement. The problem definition should 
include actions to be enabled and/or measurable outcomes to be achieved. Even better? If the 
problem is clearly tied to top-of-mind operational challenges or strategic objectives. 

Because machine learning is time and data intensive, a critical evaluation of whether existing analytic 
models/approaches or alternate solutions may apply is also in order. This ensures potential value is 
commensurate with input effort.

Note! Routine decision points that are high-volume, require immediate or rapid response and/or are 
dependent on highly variable inputs are good candidates for machine learning.

Establish an Experimental Mindset

Machine learning is an iterative, experimental process. Although core algorithms are increasingly 
commoditized, every project must be customized based on the business context and data. As with 
any good experiment, some hypotheses will be proven false. New data may need to be procured or 
created. Or the problem statement recast based on what is found. As a result, decision makers and 
team members alike must adopt a test-and-learn mentality for machine learning to succeed. Use a 
gated, iterative process that provides the flexibility and agility to quickly assess progress to determine 
whether an alternate approach is warranted or when enough is enough. 

Enlist a Collaborative Data Science Team

ML expertise is a requirement. Equally important is a dynamic teaming model that engages diverse 
experts with business, data and technical expertise. This includes data experts that can assess and 
onboard requisite data assets, business experts to provide context, assess implications (business, 
social, moral) of proposed actions or new product or service offerings and IT personnel who deploy 
and maintain the technical ecosystems. Not to be overlooked: resources who can translate between 
the language of the “quant” (i.e. those who speak math) and that of the business.

Develop a Robust Data Strategy and Ecosystem

Machine learning runs on data. A lot of data. Establishing a data process to effectively identify, acquire 
(or create), provision and access high-quality data and information assets is critical. To that end, 
governance policies and the data ecosystem must support exploratory environments (often referred 
as sandboxes) as well as production environments. This requires a multi-tiered approach to balance 
access and agility without sacrificing security, privacy, or quality. The introduction of non-traditional 
(big) data sources including unstructured text, voice, pictures and so on may also require new data 
management capabilities.

Assess the Organization’s Risk Tolerance

From agreeing on the criteria for what is “good enough” to understanding how to validate and 
develop models, machine learning often challenges traditional approaches to quality assurance and 
risk management. Why? At some point, the training wheels or, in this case, the training data must 
come off. Real validation comes from testing the performance of the machine against new data. Very 
often, this entails putting the system into operational practice. This may range from performing “A/B 
testing” in production to confirm a model will incent desired customer behaviors to taking a self-
driving car on the road with a human overseer ready to take the wheel in a crisis.

Commit to Adapting Established Business Processes 

Whether automating an existing decision point or enabling a net new product or service offering, 
ML is disruptive. Assessing potential implications to existing business processes, functions and roles 
is key. This doesn’t mean architecting the entire change before you start. But a quick gut check can 
mitigate the potential for costly moot exercises. To plan for the plan, begin by asking: “If we answer 
this question or provide this hypothesis, what can we do with the information? How might this impact 
existing processes? Are we willing and able to make the requisite changes?”

Commit to Adopting New IT Practices

Once deployed, iterative modeling and tuning of the machine learning model should continue. The 
cadence at which updates are required is unpredictable, not conforming to traditional scheduled 
deployment windows. As a result, deploying machine learning requires fundamentally different QA 
and deployment models, skill sets and service levels than traditional IT DevOps practices.
