Simple document search (boolean retrieval) created during an university course based on [Christopher D. Manning, Prabhakar Raghavan and Hinrich Sch√ºtze, Introduction to Information Retrieval, Cambridge University Press. 2008](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/).

Currently supports only AND queries, e.g. `machine learning optimization` to find documents containing all these words.
