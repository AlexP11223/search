Introduction 

Explore how Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Machine Learning (ML) can be 
applied to the network use-cases. 
As networks get more and more dynamic & complex, there are new 
challenges to network management and optimization! 
Can NAI help? 


What is a role of a central controller / SDN? 
Use Intelligence to drive the controller. 
Implement the recommendations & decisions made by the AI.


This use-case document discusses how the Network Artificial Intelligence 
(NAI) is able to be applied in the various possible use-cases.



Key Functions

Telemetry 
and Historical 
Data

Learning 

Analytics

•Detection
•Prescription
•Prediction




Closed 
Loop 
Control 

•Via SDN




•Build a Network Telemetry Analytics (NTA) engine, usually collocated with a central 
controller. 
•E2E deployment may involve multiple NTA engines coordinating with each other 
similar to the controllers. 



Enhance Path Computation and 
Traffic Engineering

PCE has access to TEDB + LSP-DB
Adding history records of the changes in the 
LSP-DB and TEDB for future analytics
Adding Network Telemetry as well as real-time 
analytics of traffic monitoring, statistics etc. 
PCE reroute/re-optimize using the historical trend 
and predications from NAI.
PCE could handle the changes in bandwidth 
utilization and other performance monitoring 
data for predicted traffic congestion avoidance.

PCEP, BGP-LS 
etc.


Route Monitoring and Analytics

BMP can be used to monitor the BGP peer. 
The controller can monitor the BGP status and routing information of the routers 
using BMP. 
Historical records of changes can be maintained in the NTA for analytics.
Performance Telemetry information about inter-AS links. 
Possible use-cases
BGP Route Leaks 
BGP Hijacks 
Traffic Analytics and intelligent Egress Traffic Engineering


Intelligent detection via anomaly detection!

Multilayer Fault Detection in NFV

Telemetry data from all layers -
CPU performance, memory usage, interface 
bandwidth and other KPI indicators can be monitored. 
At the same time resource occupancy and the life 
cycle of NVF software process can also be monitored. 


Historical records –correlate and categorize. 
Through the NAI, the relevant statistical data in 
multiple levels can be analyzed and the models can 
be setup to locate the root cause for the possible 
fault in the multi-layer environment. 
Intelligent Health Diagnostic.

Smart SFC

Network Telemetry -delay, jitter, packet loss from the network. 
Service telemetry -CPU/memory usage utilizations from the SFs.
Via sFlow/gRPCprotocol and stored as historical records.
The analytics component in NTA can build models to predict the 
impact on various Service Function Paths due to network events, 
traffic and state of the SFPs and instruct the SFC controller to take 
necessary actions.
The SFC controller can calculate new paths/reroute the SFC path 
to avoid congested Ports/SFFs or overloaded SFs.

Architectural Considerations

Placement of NTA 
Collocated with Controller
Integrated with controller


Handling of multi-domain 
controllers
Analytics closer to the source is 
better! 
Hierarchy (like ACTN…) 




Building Blocks
Telemetry Collector (Data 
Collector)
Data Movement
Analytics –real time or batch 
ML Models

Next Steps

Are these the right set of use-case to explore AI/ML in the networks? 
Do you have other use-cases? 
Is it useful to document them and discuss? 
Please suggest and collaborate! 


What are the architectural considerations? 
Are there any protocol considerations? 
Are there are operations considerations? 


Build prototypes, reuse various possible open-source. 
Hopefully in a future Hackathon!
